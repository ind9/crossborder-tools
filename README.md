# crossborder-tools
This project was part of the first avalara hackathon.

## What is this?
This is a tool that takes an excel file which the cross border team gets and runs some validation on the file.
The validation rules are what the crossborder team does manually every time they get a new file.

I'm trying to see if this can be extended as a tool kit for the cross-border team to automate some of the manual
validation that they do.
